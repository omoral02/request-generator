# Request Generator
## Setup Instructions
1. `git clone https://github.com/omoral02/traffic_generator_http_requests.git`
2. `mkdir ~/Workspace/request-generator`
3. `cd request-generator`
4. `npm install`
5. `node index.js`

After executing the last step in your terminal, you will be prompted for the URL you want to request and the number of times you'd like to request it. After all the requests are completed, you will be able to view details (URL, end time of last request and number of requests made) of the requests you made in the file test-details.txt which is stored at the root of the project directory.
